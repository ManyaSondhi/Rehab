   - Total active therapy time
   - Rest intervals and fatigue indicators

These metrics are presented visually to both patients and healthcare providers to monitor progress and adjust therapy plans accordingly.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. Webcam Not Detected
   - Ensure no other applications are using the webcam
   - Check device manager to verify webcam is properly installed

   - For browser games, ensure you've granted camera permissions

2. Game Performance Issues
   - Close resource-intensive background applications
   - Ensure adequate lighting for optimal hand tracking
   - Reduce resolution in the settings if necessary

3. Hand Tracking Problems
   - Position your hand within 20-70cm from the camera
   - Avoid complex backgrounds that may interfere with detection
   - Ensure there is sufficient contrast between your hand and background

4. Python Game Launch Issues
   - Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
   - Check Python version compatibility (3.7+ required)
   - Ensure Pygame is properly configured for your system

5. Browser Game Issues
   - Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
   - Update your browser to the latest version
